Doodle Race
-----------

Remember when you had boring French class and  you  scribbled  things on paper
with your  best friend instead of paying attention? One game we used to play a
lot was a  turn  based  racing  game  where  you  take  turns manipulating the
acceleration of a car to get around a race track.

We took this  game  to  the  next  level  by adding nitro boosts, teleporters,
slippery  oil  and  jumps  to  make  the  races more interesting. I eventually
decided to implement this as a computer game.

This game  comes with a level editor so you can draw your own maps. To see how
that          looks,         watch          this          video          here:
