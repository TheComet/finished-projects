Multiplayer Asteroids
---------------------

This is a  remake  of  the  classic  game "Asteroids" on the Atari, with extra
stuff  such  as  a  shield  power up,  bullet  spread  power  up,  and  mines.

The game can be played on the same keyboard with up to 4 people. There is also
an  "infinite  mode"  (the asteroids keep splitting forever) and a "maze mode"
where you can practice your piloting skills.

The  biggest  issue  with  this  game is the poor implementation of  collision
detection. The game gets really slow when there are  lots  of asteroids on the
screen.
